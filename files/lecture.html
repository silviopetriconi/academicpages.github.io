# Reminder: Why Deposit Insurance?

Last class we discussed the bank run model of [Diamond and Dybvig (1983)](#refpage1). Quick reminder:
  - Consumers were ex-ante uncertain whether they prefer to consume _early_ (t=1) or _late_ (t=2).
  - Restricted asset space: 
      * (liquid) _short asset_: matures every period, zero return
      * (illiquid) _long asset_: matures in t=2, positive return but early liquidation only at loss relative to purchase price
  - In autarky, no consumer would hold the long asset.
  - Banks offer consumers liquidity insurance: 
     * issue demand deposits, redeemable anytime
     * invest in a mix of short and long asset
     * depositors share surplus from long asset investment 
     * Pareto improvement!

# Reminder: Why Deposit Insurance?

What was the problem? 

--

 __Bank runs!__  Model has multiple equilibria:
  1. _"Good equilibrium"_: If depositors expect everyone to withdraw
    according to their type, late types don't withdraw early and the Pareto optimum is attained. 
  2. _"Run equilibrium"_: If depositors expect some late consumers to withdraw "early" in t=1,    banks' costly premature liquidation of the long asset will inflict losses on whoever withdraws late!&lt;br&gt;
     `\(\Rightarrow\)` Late consumers will want to withdraw early &lt;br&gt; `\(\Rightarrow\)` _Bank run_&lt;br&gt;
     `\(\Rightarrow\)` Inefficient liquidation of long asset. Pareto inferior.
  
Remedy: __Deposit insurance__

# Deposit Insurance

To break the logic of panic-based runs in [Diamond-Dybvig (1983)](#refpage1), deposit insurance can help:

 * Insured depositors always get paid in full:&lt;br&gt; 
   insurance covers eventual shortfall if bank can't pay.
 * No incentive for late consumers to withdraw early, even if they
   think that other late consumers will withdraw in t=1.
 * Eliminates Pareto-inferior bank run equilibrium completely!
 
Indeed bank
runs, once a common phenomenon all over the U.S., have practically disappeared following the
introduction of deposit insurance:
 * FDIC: 1933 Banking Act, 
 * NCUA: 1934 Federal Credit Union Act.

# Moral Hazard: Risk Shifting

But we shouldn't conclude that all is great: deposit insurance opens 
up an obvious new channel of moral hazard: depositors no longer demand compensation commensurate to bank risk!

Consider a bank that runs for one period, zero interest on deposits, liquidates fully in t=1:
.pull-left[ 
.center[__t=0__]

| Assets               | Liabilities |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| Loans L              | Deposits D  |
| Insurance Premiums P | Equity E    |
]

.pull-right[
.center[__t=1__]

| Assets               | Liabilities |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| Loans `\(\tilde L\)`              | Deposits D  |
| Insurance Payments `\(\tilde S\)` | Liq. value `\(\tilde V\)` |

]

---
# Moral Hazard: Risk Shifting


 * At date 1, insurance pays `\(\tilde S = \max(0, D-\tilde L)\)`
 * So liq. value of bank is `\(\tilde V = \tilde L -D + \tilde S\)`
 * Combining the two, we have
    `$$\tilde V = \tilde L - D + \max(0, D-\tilde L)$$`
 * From balance sheet identity in t=0, we know that `\(D=L+P-E\)`, so
    `$$\tilde V = E + (\tilde L - L) - P +\max(0, D-\tilde L)$$`
  We interpret this that the banks' liquidation value is initial equity plus value gain `\(\tilde L - L\)` in loans plus
  a term
      `$$\max(0, D-\tilde L)-P$$`
      
  `\(\Rightarrow\)`  reads like a put option on bank assets `\(\tilde L\)` at strike `\(D\)`!

# The Classic Risk Shifting Problem

This equivalence between deposit insurance and a put option on bank assets was first recognized in a seminal paper by [Merton (1977)](#refpage2).

# Cross Country Evidence
[Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache (2002)](#refpage1) present a cross-country empirical study of deposit insurance moral hazard:
 * gradual introduction of deposit insurance in 61 countries over the time period 1980-1997
 * around half of the 898 observations fall into periods in which deposit insurance is available
 
They ask: 

 * With deposit insurance, are there more or fewer banking crises?
 * Does banking crisis probability depend on specific deposit insurance design features, e.g. government involvement, funding status, coinsurance, coverage limits?
 * In all this, does quality of (legal) institutions matter?

---
# Cross Country Evidence (cont.)

Key Findings:

 * Detrimental effect of explicit deposit insurance on banking stability
 * Effect more pronounced where institutions are weak
 * Higher coverage caps, more credible pre-funding of deposit insurance and presence of government in deposit insurance scheme increase the risk of crisis.

# Bail-Outs and Moral Hazard

Expectations that a bank will receive a bail-out generates analogous moral hazard channel as deposit insurance. However, there are important differences:
  * Whilst all banks have deposit insurance by law, bail-outs are discretionary.
  * Receiving a bail-out may depend on political connections, systemic relevance of the institution etc.
  * Asymmetric coverage by bail-out implies that competitors of banks that are under the umbrella of bail-out stand in the rain, facing fiercer competition for depositors, market share; this damages their charter value. 
  * Consequence [(Hakenes and Schnabel, 2010)](#refpage2): bail outs increase risk in competitors!! 
  * Empirically holds, see [Hakenes, Schnabel and Gropp (2010)](#refpage2).

#Promise vs. Reality of Bail-ins
---
# Bail-in as solution?

**"Let private money pay for the next bail-out"...**

 * Bail-in regimes give regulators the power to declare 
   at their discretion the bail-in of some (typically subordinated) debt.
   The debt is written off / converted to equity to relieve the ailing
   financial institution. 
 * In theory, these risky debt claims are thought to impose discipline on institutions because their risk _is_ priced.
 * In reality,use of this instrument complicated, much to be learned:
     - banks used intentional misselling of bail-in debt to particularly vulnerable groups as to force bail-out
     - Cyprus bail-in gave equity (and thus control) into hands of people who (due to proximity to Kremlin) would never have been granted a banking license.
