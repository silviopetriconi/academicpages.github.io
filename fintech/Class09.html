# PSD2 and Bank APIs

#Second European Payment Services Directive 

The [**PSD2 (Directive EU 2015/2366)**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2015/2366/oj) was passed by the EU Council on 16 November 2015. It harmonizes payment services
across the European Union. One of its key innovations is that it also
regulates the provision of payment services by nonbank intermediaries
like money remittance services and payment initiation providers
(e.g. [Sofort](https://www.klarna.com/sofort/)).

With a certain minimum capital and specific risk management measures in place, anyone (without banking license) can become 
   * an __account information service provider__ (AISP): 
     a provider who retrieves and aggregates information from various
     accounts of the customer, e.g. a banking app that shows your global
     wealth status by aggregating over all your accounts at different 
     banks.
   * a __payment initiation service provider__ (PISP):
     a provider of payment initiation services, i.e. a nonbank that 
     can delegate payment instructions to a bank. Example: 
     a universal banking app that works with more than one bank and
     across accounts.
     
Commercial banks are required to enable API-level access to their
account and payment functions with consent of the account holder.

More on PSD2 [here](https://www.pwc.com/it/en/industries/banking/assets/docs/psd2-nutshell-n03.pdf).

#Legal limits to API data use

Contrary what is reported in some media, the PSD2 establishes narrow boundaries for the use of API data: See e.g. 
Article 67,

&gt; _The account information service provider shall:_
&gt;
&gt;* (...)
&gt;* _not request sensitive payment data linked to the payment accounts;_
&gt;* _not use, access or store any data for purposes other than for performing the account information service explicitly requested by the payment service user, in accordance with data protection rules._

The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679
obviously also applies to API account data. 

---
#APIs and the (lack of) standardization

Whilst the legislation mandates that banks must publish APIs, it does not
specify __which__ kind of API. There is no standardization mandated by PSD2!
 * however, the UK national implementation of PSD2 mandates a standardized
   API format for the UK's nine largest banks (see [Open Banking](https://www.openbanking.org.uk)) that exposes all transaction
   data of customers to third parties.
 * banks that are signed up for Open Banking include RBS, Santander, Barclays, Lloyds, HSBC, Nationwide, Danske Bank, Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks
 * it's not a straightforward question what's better for which kind
   of bank in terms
  of compatibility: provide widely a compatible API 
  (and make access to customer
   data by third parties even easier, increasing customer satisfaction but also inviting competition) or develop an incompatible
   API as a shield against competitors at the risk of annoying customers.
 * wild growth of incompatible APIs has created scope for firms  
   like [Tink](https://tink.com) or [banksapi](https://banksapi.de/produkte-sicherheit/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAn8nuBRCzARIsAJcdIfOdTqWRr_1JqttfCrj905qydv8Griu32w4xT6W9PO4TkPtn3WWtXWsaAvf-EALw_wcB) that specialize in providing a general purpose API for end developers, and implement a mapping of general purpose API calls into bank-specific API calls.

#APIs and banks' sluggish response

Banks had time until 14 September 2019 to create and publish
APIs for access to their account and payment services. 
[According to an late-August 2019 analysis of Tink](https://tink.com/blog/2019/08/21/psd2-status-update), this was the situation 3 weeks before the deadline:

# Lots of things to clarify...

Even now, [not everything](https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/17919/psd2---10-questions-i-would-like-to-see-a-clear-answer-on) is clear regarding the enforcement of PSD2, there are lots of open questions such as:
 * will corporate accounts be within the scope of the directive?
   If so, how are the complex multi-eyes signature mechanisms for
   corporate customers to be implemented?
 * for a one-time usage of a financial app, will retail customers accept the large burden of signing into their online banking with two-factor
 authentication and approve the app?
 * is it allowed to store with customer consent historical data that will otherwise become
   unavailable via the API? Which data can FinTech's use for ML purposes?
 * can anonymized data be used for further value creation? The legal answer here is a clear __NO__. But we have witnessed that large tech players have been going against the law, were not prosecuted to the same extent as small offenders, and finally got the law changed in their 
 favor to legalize their business ex-post (with plenty
 of lobbying). Considering the business models currently being 
 proposed I do get the sense that some 
 entrants to PSD2 data markets are betting on this.

# The value of payment data

# The (direct) value of account data

Bank account data tell a life's story: from bank account data, one can
   * validate __employer, income, taxes__ paid including residential
     property taxes (proxy for property value!)
   * follow geographic trajectory of a person:
     specific __geolocation__ of some spendings (tolls, restaurants, ATMs)
   * infer which kind of __insurances__ someone currently has and which 
     rates those insurance are charging
   * see which __mortgage installments__ are being paid (and, when combined
   with credit registry data on mortgage size, determine 
     whether the rate on the mortgage is competitive relative to the current
     market situation)
   * infer the degree of __financial sophistication__ of the account holder
   * learn about the account holder's network of __socioeconomic ties__, e.g.
     from payments supporting children, parents
   * suspect an account holder's involvement in __criminal 
     activity / money laundering__
   * ... probably do much more - the limiting factor is your imagination.

# The (direct) value of payment data

Payment data that are not linked to a checking account (e.g. Apple Pay data, credit card transaction data) still tell a lot about a customer:
  * spending behavior
  * preferences, to some extent (payment data don't disclose shopping basket)
  * willingness to shop at local competitors or internet stores
  
When combined with other data sources (cashier scanner data of shopping baskets, loyalty programs, Bluetooth mobile phone beacons), payment data make it possible to observe from which competitors customers end up buying, which has high monetary value:
  * Pricing strategies: extract more surplus from more captive
    customer groups
  * Marketing strategies: target better the most valuable
    customer group 
  
__Note:__ nearly all payment methods (except cash) de-anonymize the shopping basket of the customer. The seller can then run a detailed 
market analysis.

#A network view of payment data


---
# Value chains and risk propagation

Payment data can also reveal one of the best-guarded secrets of the economy: the structure of supply chains and value chains. If one had a global view of all payment data, one would see
 * which firm is supplying to which other firm
 * what the financial strength of each firm in the value network is
 * how their business is evolving
 * whether there are reasons for distress upstream in the network.
 
Banks normally don't have such a global view: competition partitions the
payment network into many subnetworks that each bank can see, but that 
are too incomplete to yield a full picture. [Even stock investors](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01379.x) fail
to correctly price interfirm linkages, partially for the lack of dependable
information.

A market-dominant payment platform would however see everything. These network data carry enough information to
 * forecast propagation of distress events in the supply chain [(Barrot and Sauvagnat, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjw018)
 * estimate credit risk more precisely [(Cossin and Shellhorn, 2007)](https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0715)

#Recovering the interbank market from LVPS payment data

The recovery of interbank loans from LVPS pyment data is a great example of a typical payment data workflow:
 1. Feature engineering guided by domain knowledge of what you're looking for
 2. Machine learning (or even hard classification rules)
 3. Verification
 
We'll read in class the following papers:

 * the [Furfine algorithm](https://www.bis.org/publ/work70.pdf)
 * [assessing the quality of Furfine](https://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb16q1a8.pdf)
