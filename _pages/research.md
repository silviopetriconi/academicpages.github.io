## Working papers

__[Bank competition, information choice and inefficient lending booms](https://silviopetriconi.github.io/files/petriconi_lending_boom.pdf)__ 
:  If loan offers of informed banks can be observed by uninformed competitors, 
   banks will lend excessively and screen too little. More bank competition exacerbates the problem and yields inefficient boom-bust cycles in credit.


__[The redistributive effects of bank capital regulation](https://silviopetriconi.github.io/files/CMP_redistributive_regulation.pdf)__ 
_(with E. Carletti & R. Marquez)_
:  In a general equilibrium model of bank capital, we show that
   depositors are likely to bear most of the cost of stricter regulatory
   capital standards, whereas shareholders may benefit from regulation.


__[Geeks Bearing Gifts: Competition and Information Sharing in Knowledge-Based Service Industry](https://silviopetriconi.github.io/files/knowledgesharing.pdf)__ _(with Doh-Shin Jeon)_
:  In a service economy where value is co-created by service providers and customers, a commitment to knowledge sharing with rival firms by means of open source software licensing can incentivize stronger customer collaboration and raise the incumbent's profitability.
