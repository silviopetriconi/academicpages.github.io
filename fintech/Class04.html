# Cryptography (symmetric key)

For many things in life and business, it is essential that others can't read your data. This is a __very__ old problem of humanity...

Already 2000 years ago people were having ways of transmitting
military information while reducing the risk of such sensitive data
falling into wrong hands!

The idea of a __symmetric encryption cipher__ is simple: have a family of invertible (and hopefully sufficiently complicated and diverse) encryption functions `\((f)^{key}\)` indexed by the encryption `\(key\)` such that:

`\(X = f^{key}(plaintext)\)`

where `\(X\)` is an encrypted version of the plain text data that no longer 
resembles them in any way. If the encryption function is well chosen,
only a person knowing the key should be able to retrieve the plain text
without unreasonable effort:

`\(plaintext = (f^{key})^{-1}(X)\)`




---
# The Caesar Cipher

A simple (and totally insecure) example of symmetric key cryptography 
is the
encryption cipher that was used by 
Gaius Julius Caesar: he shifted all letters of the alphabet by a certain 
offset, writing c instead of a, d instead of b, etc.

Can you break the code?

# The key exchange problem

Modern symmetric key ciphers like [Twofish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twofish) or [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) are infinitely more powerful
in protecting against the many weaknesses of simple ciphers like 
the Caesar cipher. However, they all share one ultimate problem: 
for the receiver to be able to read the message, its encryption key
must already have been communicated via some secure channel to the receiver.

This is not much of a problem when we're storing a message for 
our own purpose. But it seems an unsurmountable issue when we try to 
send encrypted communication to a party with whom we have
never been able to establish a secure channel to exchange keys. 


[Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman (1976)](https://ee.stanford.edu/%7Ehellman/publications/24.pdf) were the first to describe a method to get around
this problem: 

__Asymmetric encryption__ with public and private keys:

&gt;_In a public key cryptosystem enciphering and deciphering are governed by distinct keys, E and D, such that computing D from E is computationally infeasible (e.g., requiring `\(10^{100}\)` instructions). _

---
#Asymmetric-key cryptography

This is how asymmetric key cryptography is used:

 * Obtain (typically by choosing a passphrase augmented with further sources of randomness) a key pair _(sk, pk)_ comprising of the secret key _sk_ (also
 often referred to as private key), and the public key _pk_. [Try this.](https://anders.com/blockchain/public-private-keys/keys)

 * Distribute the public key _pk_ to the general public, and make sure
   everyone knows your public key. Keep the secret key private.
   
 * Anyone wanting to send an encrypted message _msg_ to you
   can encrypt it using your public key:
   
   `\(X = encrypt(msg, pk)\)`
   
 * The message can now only be decrypted by the secret key _sk_.
   


.footnote[*A wonderfully simple explanation of the technology behind public-private key 
cryptography can be found [here](https://bitfalls.com/2017/11/16/cryptography-mortals-lets-explain-public-private-keys/). If you're interested in the source code 
of a simple pure Python implementation of RSA, see this [link](https://gist.github.com/ErbaAitbayev/8f491c04af5fc1874e2b0744965a732b). For purposes of this course it suffices if you know how to use asymmetric key cryptography, not why it works.]

#Digital signatures
Digital signatures are a close cousin of asymmetric key encryption: many 
asymmetric key encryption methods (e.g. RSA) provide a canonical way to 
sigitally sign unencrypted data by add a digital signature
at the end of an unencrypted message. Try this on your own
[here](https://anders.com/blockchain/public-private-keys/signatures).

Steps:

 * Invent a secret password, which will become your secret key _sk_. 
   The software will calculate from that your publikc key _pk_ that
   you can publish anywhere.
   
 * Write an unencrypted message _m_. To prove to everyone who knows
   your public key that you were the one who wrote this message, 
   "sign" it by computing its digital signature _sign(m, sk)_ with
   your secret key. Append this signature to the message.
   
 * Everyone can then use a verification function _verify(m, pk, sg)_ that
   should return `True` only if the signature _sg_ is equal to 
   _sign(m, sk)_ to ascertain the validity of the message.

Why does this matter? Digital signatures are used to authorize transactions!

# The double spending problem

# Digital coins and double spending

Naively, we might think that digital signatures provide a natural way
for creating digital coins that can be passed on from one to another:

A coin would be a file which carries the digital signature of the 
payer agreeing to give the coin to the payee (identified by a
public key). 

The digital signature indeed proves that the payee rightfully received
the coin from the payer. The payee could spend the coin by amending his/her own signature and the public key of the next receiver:

However, this "native" currency doesn't work: the initial owner
of the coin can always retain a copy of the
coin before digitally signing it over to the payee. After that, the former owner of the coin could use the backup copy to make further 
payments to other parties. 

We refer to this as __double spending__. It is obvious that a digital coin 
must be scarce to have value, yet this system would allow its users
to spend the same money more than once.

# Satoshi's idea

# Satoshi's white paper

On 31st of October 2008, an anonymous developer posted unter the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto a [paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
on a cryptographic mailing list. 

It describes a decentralized currency, Bitcoin.

__We will now jointly read it. __

It remains the single best source to
understand the idea behind Bitcoin, and it's not very technical
at all. We've already learned about Merkle trees, Merkle proofs and
digital signatures, so
we can understand _everything_ that Satoshi is talking about.

# Bitcoin addresses

In the actual implementation of Bitcoin, coins are held at addresses
that are derived from public keys that anyone can create on a computer.
For the purpose of increased security, these public keys are hashed with SHA256 and RIPEMD160:

```
ADDR=RIPEMD160(SHA256(publickey))
```

We will refer to this as 

```
hash160(publickey)
```

The final address is written down in [BASE58 encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base58), which essentially 
is a reduced alphanumerical set that excludes some letters and numbers
which are otherwise easily confused, e.g. (0, O), (I, l, 1).

An example of a valid Bitcoin address is

```text
1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa
```
(The first-ever block reward was sent to this address)

---
# Bitcoin addresses (cont.)

One reason why Bitcoin uses double-hashed public keys as addresses
rather than public keys directly is to increase cryptographic 
security: to uniquely identify the receiver of a payment, the hash of a 
public key is just as good as a public key. The public key of an
address is only disclosed once the holder of the address authenticates
a payment (for which the owner of the address must provide the 
actual public key to the network as to enable miners to validate
the signature of the payment instruction.). 

Imagine now that, for example due to a weakness in the cryptography
algorithm or the use of quantum computing, some day it becomes 
feasible to compute a private key from a public key. 

Then at least all funds of addresses from which no bitcoins were
ever spent are still safe: nobody other than their owner knows
even the public key! 

Since creating new addresses is costless, it is better 
in terms of security aspects to always spend everything in one address
and discard it afterwards. This can be done, for example, by transferring
the residual credit to a newly created address. There are also
[many other](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse) privacy-related 
arguments against
address reuse.

#Bitcoin: Unit of account

The atomic unit of account in Bitcoin is 1 Satoshi `\(\equiv 10^{-8}\)` BTC. 
Addresses themselves do not preserve information about the amount that
the addresses are holding; how many Satoshis reside at an address 
at any given point in time is
rather computed by counting all unspent transaction outputs (UXTO) 
that list this address as their destination.

# Genesis block: the first block ever

The first block in a blockchain is referred to as the Genesis block. 
[This](https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f) is the genesis block of Bitcoin...

We can see that there is only one transaction. The _"coinbase transaction"_, i.e. the block reward for
finding a nonce that enables the hash of the genesis block 
to start with the required number of zeros goes to Satoshi's first
address.

In the beginning, the required level of difficulty was low (as not to
delay the frequency of blocks beyond the target time). At the same 
time, the reward paid out to the miners was particularly high:

According to the Bitcoin protocol, block rewards decline as follows:

#Bitcoin proof of work

We explore Bitcoin proof of work in the Blockchain simulator.
If you're non-attending, run your own copy (or watch the video)
from [this link](https://anders.com/blockchain/).

Bitcoin's proof of work comprises in finding a nonce that results
in a block hash smaller than some target number. By increasing the 
_difficulty_, the target number is reduced and are therefore harder to mine. 


Bitcoin algorithmically resets its difficulty of mining every 2016 blocks,
targeting a difficulty level that allows for one mined block every 10 minutes (in expectation).
The odd number 2016 for the difficulty reset
simply reflects the fact that with a targeted time of 
10 minutes per block, difficulty readjusts every two weeks, which should
mean every `\(14*24*60/10=2016\)` blocks. 



---


#Bitcoin monetary policy

Monetary policy in Bitcoin is defined by a fixed rule.

The initial block reward for finding a block is 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks (which at the targeted speed of block creation is reached
after every 3.5 years), this block reward is cut into half. It's a _geometric series!_

Reward level 1 (which was exhausted in Dec 2011 upon reaching block 210,000) did create 210,000 * 50 BTC = 10500000 BTC.

Reward level 2 (which was exhausted in July 2015) created 210,000 * 25 BTC

(and so on).

The geometric series converges to a fixed amount. Moreover,
after finite time the block reward will fall below 1 Satoshi
and thus become zero.
As a consequence, in total only 21,000,000 BTC will ever be mined.

Of those, as of today 17,960,600 (85.5%) have [already been mined](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/how-many-bitcoins-are-there/).

# Outlook

Next week we'll look more at the details of Bitcoin, understand the
security level of distributed consensus, and the economics that keeps
distributed consensus working. 

We'll also look at mining, centralization and blockchain forks.
