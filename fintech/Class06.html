#From Bitcoin script to Ethereum

# Bitcoin Script?

There's one part of _Bitcoin_ that we haven't talked about yet, because for most users it is completely transparent, so they have no contact with it, ever:
__Bitcoin Script__. It's a minimalistic, [stack-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming) programming language that handles the details of a transaction such as
signature verification. Every transaction is in reality not sent
as a tuple of (sender, receiver, signature), but as a little sequence 
of instructions that instruct the miner what exactly to do.

Why was an entire mini-language included in Bitcoin? 
 * to support multisig transactions: transactions which require m out of n people to sign the transaction to become valid
 * to support slightly more advanced payment logic, such as i inputs, j outputs.

The details of the Bitcoin script specification can be found [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Opcodes).

&gt; _The script is actually a predicate. It's just an equation that evaluates to true or false. Predicate is a long and unfamiliar word so I called it script._ - Satoshi Nakamoto

Bitcoin script must be validated and executed by the miners. The problem:

# The Halting Problem

Compare the following lines of code. This code will run and halt:

.small[
```python
sleep(1)
```]

This code will run forever:

.small[
```python
while True:
    continue
```]

But what will this code do:

.small[
```python
  while j &lt; i:
    j = exp(i)-sin(i)*i**2
    i = tanh(j)
```
]

**General question:** Is there a general algorithm which can determine whether this (or any other)
code will come to a final stop, looking just at the code and the initial values of its variables (e.g. i and j in the last example)?

#Turing's famous answer

.pull-left[
![Alan Turing](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Alan_Turing_az_1930-as_%C3%A9vekben.jpg)
]
.pull-right[
In 1936, [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) wrote the paper ["On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem."](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf) in which he proves that the problem is _undecidable_ over Turing machines (a mathematical idealization of
our day's computers): there exists no general algorithm that can 
decide whether a program will or will no come to a stop.

The finding bears close connections with Kurt 
Gödel's famous [incompleteness theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel%27s_incompleteness_theorems).

##Blockchain scripts: Turing-incomplete or unstoppable


The undecidability of the halting problem has direct consequences for the design of Blockchain scripting 
languages like Bitcoin script: either they are by purpose made
Turing-incomplete (e.g. by taking away the possibility to have loops), 
or they can potentially run forever (__on the miners' machines!__).  By Turing's proof of the 
undecidability of the 
Halting problem, we can't hope to build some sort of filter that
prevent scripts that won't halt from running.

Since the scripts must be executed by the network's validator nodes
(not on the computer which submitted them), this is a big security problem.

* Satoshi Nakamoto implemented Bitcoin script as 
a Turing-incomplete language.
It lacks the instructions for loops such that it will always be
executed sequentially and come to
a halt. The price for this is that only the most simple algorithms 
can be implemented in Bitcoin script.

* Vitalik Buterin wondered how much more interesting things 
could be done if one just had a Turing-complete language on a
blockchain. If its execution could just be stopped...!
Maybe a simple pragmatic solution, like budget constraints for resource use, could work?

# Stopping the unstoppable: (Out of) Gas

With a car, you can't go any further if you've run out of gas.
Why not apply this principle to scripts for the Blockchain? That's exactly  Ethereum's approach:
 * Every instruction costs a certain amount of gas.
 * The distrinction between _gas_ and _Ether_ as units of account is made
   to decouple measures of computational complexity from valuation of
   a cryptocurrency.
 * You're required to endow every contract with a certain amount of gas
 (_gasLimit_ parameter) that gets depleted when processed by miners, and miners get paid.
 * When your contract is out of gas, it stops running, fees remain
   paid. No matter what you did or didn't get to do.
 * The gas price is indirectly determined by miners: miners pick
   transactions according to the _gasPrice_ that the transaction is
   bidding for and
   decline to process contracts that bid too low a gas price.
   High _gasPrice_ buys you priority processing.
   Check the current market prices of your fuel grade at the [gas station](https://ethgasstation.info).

# Ethereum

Vitalik Buterin and other co-founders developed Ethereum as a 
blockchain that includes a Turing complete virtual machine from scratch. 

 * two kind of accounts: 
     - _external accounts_ which are controlled by public keys (as in Bitcoin)
     - _contract accounts_ which are governed by a _smart contract_, i.e. a piece of software being executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

 * to create a contract, one sends a transaction with receiver
   `null` and binary payload code; the payload is executed and its
   result (not the payload!) is saved as a new smart contract at a 
   new address.
 * contracts can also send messages between each other. More [here](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.3/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html).


.footnote[__Homework__: Read the full [white paper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) of Ethereum. Unlike the pile of meaningless garbage that has been blogged about Ethereum by people who don't even understand its fundamental
mechanics, the white paper 
explains in human-understandable terms what it is, how it works, and 
what its economics is. I don't expect you to understand Ethereum at the level of its [yellow paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf).]

# Ethereum cryptocurrency units

In Ethereum, the built-in cryptocurrency unit is the _Ether_. The smallest atomistic unit of account (like one Satoshi in Bitcoin) is 1 _wei_. 
   
   Unit    | Name
----------|-----
`\(1\)`       | wei
`\(10^{12}\)`   | szabo
`\(10^{15}\)`   | finney
`\(10^{18}\)`   | ether

Initially, Ether also was sold by the cryptocurrency developers
in a currency sale at prices around 1000-2000 Ether per BTC. 

---
# Ethereum Monetary Policy

__Some core differences with respect to Bitcoin:__
 
* initial endowment pool: by selling of ETC in exchange for BTC, 
  less control and wealth concentration in hands of original developers. 
* block mining reward incentive similar to BTC, plus rewards for uncle blocks (more about uncle blocks later), 
* permanent linear issuance of new currency, so no upper ceiling (unlike BTC), not planning for built-in deflation and allowing for coin loss over 
time.
* subject to potential future changes. 

---

# Ethereum Governance Model

__Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has a strong governance model:__

* entirely off-chain via Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) and
  Ethereum Requests for Comment (ERC)
* EIP's are [discussed](https://gitter.im/ethereum/governance), discussed more [among core developers](https://github.com/ethereum/pm) and eventually implemented or dropped. The core developers, of course,
can't just dictate because it may cause a fork in the community. 
They will try to persuade.
* [EIP 1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md) 
describes the official way how governance is handled on
Ethereum.
* Many miners and users have criticized the governance model of
Ethereum as close to a "social planner" and are not comfortable with
the focal role of its founder, Vitalik Buterin, in the governance
of the chain. Compare this to the total absence of Satoshi 
Nakamoto in Bitcoin.

can be found [here](https://unblock.net/what-is-ethereum-governance/).]

#Ethereum Decentralization

In Bitcoin, several forces created bias towards centralization:
 * pooled mining
 * highly specific assets for mining: ASICs
 * network latency creates risk of mining stale blocks that don't
   end up on final chain
   
If blocks are to be mined at a rate faster than every 10 minutes,
forces that favor centralization will get worse! 
At the same time, decentralization is essential for security of the
network.

Attempts to
address this in Ethereum:
 * proof of work algorithm that is ASIC-hard, i.e. unlikely to be more 
   efficient on ASIC than on normal GPU.
 * GHOST protocol that also rewards stale blocks.
   More about this now.

# Stale Blocks and Uncles


---
# Reminder: the problem of stale blocks

.pull-left[![Stale block](img/staleblocks.svg)]

.pull-right[When mining Bitcoin, there's a chance that a new block is found by two miners almost simultaneously. Both will propagate "their" block to their peers.

Eventually more miners will mine on one block than on the other and
its chain will become longer than the other. At this point,
remaining miners switch to mine on the longer chain. 
Block #0816.v2 becomes _stale_, its mining reward is lost and can't be spent.

The faster you learn about new blocks and the faster you announce your own new blocks, the lower your risk of stale block production.

# Stale blocks and centralization

Stale blocks lead to mining centralization / agglomeration: 
* If I know that the 
majority of miners are mining in location X, and the network needs 
time to report any block that I find to location X
(_"latency"_), I should move close to location X as well to minimize 
wasted time in stale block production.

* This is detrimental to network security.

* A network with faster block times (e.g. one block every 10 seconds) produces stale blocks at _much_ higher rate than a network with slow
block times (e.g. one block
every 10 minutes) because the network's nodes are "out of sync" for
higher percentage of overall time.

* Therefore, without changes to mining incentives, a faster network's security would be compromised due to strong incentive for centralization.

For smart contracts, consensus (and thus a new block) must be reached for 
every state transition of the Ethereum VM. Impractical to wait 10
minutes in order to update one value in EVM memory, faster
block times are needed, e.g. one block every 12 seconds. **How can then centralization be averted?**

---
# GHOST and Uncle Mining


.pull-left[![Uncle blocks](img/uncles.svg)]

.pull-right[
To avoid centralization by miners' fear of stale block mining and yet
have short block times, Ethereum uses incentives inspired by the [GHOST](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/881.pdf) (Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree) protocol.

In essence, it gives some mining (but no transaction) rewards also 
to those who mine stale blocks (_"uncles"_); the surviving chain is 
chosen not as the longest chain, but as the chain with the 
heaviest observed subtree including uncle blocks (see example
on the left side: the weight of the red uncle blocks makes the 
shorter tree the winner).

This reduces centralization trends, but [is not without problems.](https://bitslog.com/2016/04/28/uncle-mining-an-ethereum-consensus-protocol-flaw/)

# Smart Contracts

---
# Solidity

The most popular language to program the Ethereum Virtual Machine is Solidity:
 * somewhat similar to JavaScript / ECMAScript, but statically typed
 * contracts can implement any logic, send messages to other contracts,
 etc.
 
Examples of functions that can be codified as Solidity smart contracts:
 * __financial derivatives:__ code can make payments at a given point
   in the future which will be contingent on the value of other inputs
   like weather, 
   
 * __cryptotokens:__ code that issues and manages a set of unique 
   tokens which may give their owners rights to receive cash flows 
   from an investment, or derive utility from a service
   
 * __distributed organizations:__ One view of the firm is that it
   comprises of
   a web of contracts that regulate state-contingent payments. 
   In principle one could think to implement distributed organizations, firms, venture capitalists, financial intermediaries via smart contracts... 

Conditional on time, we'll develop a smart contract of our own later.
 
 

---
# Code is Law

The big advantage of smart contracts is that they execute automatically:
  * In a normal contractual agreement, the counterparty can default on its obligations
  * Then, a lengthy legal process will try to force that the contract is enforced.
  * In smart contracts, instead the enforcement is automatic. In a place
    with a bad legal system, this can be a blessing.
    
But code is just code. It will do what you told it to do, which is sometimes very different from what you wanted it to do.

 * Bugs are going to be executed!
 * There's no chance to update a buggy contract ex-post.
 * **Code is law!** Bad real-world contracts get renegotiated. Bad
   smart contracts just execute nevertheless.
 * Testing is crucial. Understanding well __ALL__
   possible channels by which the contract can run out of gas
   or behave differently from what you
   expect is
   fundamental.

# The fate of the DAO

# The DAO

The first attempt to set up a distributed firm was the [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization%29) (decentralized autonomous organization) which was launched in 
May 2016 as a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain:

 * _Crowdfunded:_ Raised over $100 million by selling its ownership tokens on the Ethereum network. 
 * _Stateless and autonomous:_ no physical address, no management roles. 
   In principle not located under in any particular state of 
   the world, unclear which legislation would apply.
 * _Open source and blockchain-operated:_ everything fully transparent in principle,
   but the organization's [code](https://github.com/slockit/DAO) is complicated nevertheless.
  
Idea: organization would run autonomously, controlled by code. Would act similar to a venture capitalist that will fund other projects
   with Ether, acquire share of ownership in those. DAO tokens give
   their owners the right
   to vote on potential projects to be financed.

.right-column[In June 2016, [Emin Gün Sirer](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/egs/) (Cornell) found a security issue with the code of the DAO: 
 * some of the code was not reentrant, i.e. by entering the same contract
   function twice in a recursive call, things could go in unexpected ways
 * in fact, there was a possibility for money to be stolen. He 
   [wrote about it](http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/05/27/dao-call-for-moratorium/) in late May, 2016.
 * indeed, in June 2016 the DAO got hacked, and 3.6 million Ether (at the
   time around USD 70 million) [were stolen.](
http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/06/17/thoughts-on-the-dao-hack/)

In an unheard-of movement, the Ethereum community reacted to this spectacular hack by forcing a software-enforced hard-fork of
Ethereum on 20 July 2016 01:20:40 PM +UTC at Block 1920000 that would
restore the funds to the DAO. 

This was very controversial. Not everyone joined the hard-fork, _Ethereum classic_ is the second surviving chain.

# A lesson learned

The DAO hack illustrates extremely well how risky smart contracts can be
when their behavior is not fully understood. 

This points at two important open issues:
 * Tools for smart contract development should provide __better 
   safeguards__ against certain subtile errors
   than what Solidity is currently offering.
    -  just look at what [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) has achieved in terms of code quality guarantees in the area of systems programming relative to C++
    - there's lots of smart magic going on to prevent the worst kind of
      errors from ever even compiling into code
    - we clearly need more security-centric dedicated tools for smart contract development
    - Facebook's [Move](https://developers.libra.org/docs/move-paper) language is a substantial step in this direction (not for Ethereum but for its
    own [Libra](https://libra.org/en-US/) blockchain).
 
 * Trust in __code quality__ and __data source integrity__ will 
 always remain a first-order problem when working with smart contracts.

# Tokens and ERC-20 coins

# Tokens and ERC-20 coins

One of the most frequently used contract on Ethereum is an [ERC-20 compliant](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) token contract. 
It's a contract allowing you to issue a finite number of __tokens__
whose ownership can be traced by the blockchain. By using always
the same contract features (compliant with ERC-20), many programs
can interact with tokens of all kinds.

What can tokens be good for?

 - __utility tokens__: think for example about bus tickets or
   train tickets. In essence, they are proofs that you paid the
   relevant fare for a service that you're receiving. Utility tokens
   are a generalization of this concept: access to computing resources,
   data, other services can be paid for with utility tokens which
   developers simply issue.
   
 - __financial security token__: ownership rights etc. Do the [Howey test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_v._W._J._Howey_Co.) to see if a
   token is considered a digital financial security like 
   a share of stock:
     - It is an investment of money?
     - The investment is in a common enterprise?
     - There is an expectation of profit from the work of the promoters or the third party?

#ICOs and new forms of finance
---
#Initial Coin Offerings

Like stock, which is sold in an initial public offering (IPO), tokens
are sold in initial coin offerings (ICO). Unlike IPOs, many successful
ICO's have been made without any help from investment banks and an 
army of lawyers.

Legality, however, has been a big problem.
Crypto tokens (except those utility tokens which fail the Howey 
test) 
fall under the same regulations as __stock issuance__. Failure to
follow the regulations for stock issuance (registration with SEC,
prospectus, etc) is against the law.
Example: 
 * EOS sold [over $4bn](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/31/a-blockchain-start-up-just-raised-4-billion-without-a-live-product.html) in cryptotokens in 2018 without a live product to 
   show
 * got into trouble with the SEC, [settled](https://www.coindesk.com/eos-maker-block-one-settles-with-sec-over-unregistered-securities-sale) for a "peanuts" fine of $24M.
 

To evade regulation and oversight, many ICO's were held by firms 
located on the 
Cayman Islands or elsewhere outside U.S. jurisdiction. Naive investor demand for cryptoassets 
was stable irrespective of the legality of the transaction.

Read [here](https://www.sec.gov/ICO) the SEC's position about ICOs.

---
# ICOs: a new way of finance?

The technical ease of holding an ICO highlights that
cryptoassets, when regulated and overseen properly, hold the promise of __greatly improving access to (crowd-)funding__ for small and medium size firms that are too small
to ever even consider an IPO.

 * global scope and tradeability of tokens makes it easier to attract investors in highly specific assets
 * cost of issuance are much lower
 * boundary between financial investors and clients of the company
   becomes more blurry when utility tokens are used to crowdfund
   the production of goods/services.
   
Economists' view on ICOs: Potentially useful to overcome financing frictions!
* [Li and Mann](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/research/centres/alternative-finance/downloads/2018-af-conference/paper-li.pdf)  point out that ICOs can help overcome coordination problems 
 between investors and better source the "wisdom of the crowd"

* Consider a 
   good that requires irreversible investment in order to be
   produced, but consumers lack ability to commit ahead of time to eventually buying the 
   good. [Lee and Parlour](https://www.conftool.com/efa2019/index.php/efa2019-FIIT-5-1247-Crowdfunding%2C_Initial_Coin_Offerings%2C_and_Consumer_Surplus.pdf?page=downloadPaper&amp;filename=efa2019-FIIT-5-1247-Crowdfunding%2C_Initial_Coin_Offerings%2C_and_Consumer_Surplus.pdf&amp;form_id=1247&amp;form_version=final) show that crowdfunding can alleviate this problem. ICOs are 
   ideal to support crowdfunding.

 * are you a fan of [Lolcats](http://www.lolcats.com)[?](https://icanhas.cheezburger.com/lolcats/tag/free) 
     - No? Some people may wonder what's wrong with you, but I'm on your side.
     - Yes? Well... that's fine too.
    
But what could possibly happen when one pairs __cats__ with __cryptotokens?__

# CryptoKitties!

Soon after its launch in November 2017, [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co) became one of the most successful distributed applications _ever_
on the Ethereum blockchain. 
 * cats are collectibles
 * they can breed new cats
 * no cats is like another
 * every cat is represented in a cryptotoken
 * and people sell their rare cats to each other. Values up to __$200,000__ (!!!).
 
The consequences:
--

 * cryptokittie = single most frequently traded contract on the Ethereum network in 2018
 * 25% of network traffic on Ethereum
 * __causing substantial scalability problems and slowdown on the Ethereum network, resulting also in massive Ether devaluation.__

On the long run, one starts to wonder how much capacity for applications of this
kind there is on a distributed system that must keep nodes globally in sync.

# Viewer's Discretion is Advised

If you ever need an introduction to cryptokitties... 

This is seriously weird stuff.

# Getting an Ethereum full node to sync

With a highly loaded chain in times of cryptokitties, it has become __extremely__ hard to sync 
a full node to the Ethereum blockchain. It takes days to download 98%
and __months__ to get the remaining 2% in sync, if ever. You need
 * have super fast storage, e.g. a RAID of SSDs
 * or better, NVMe
 * and a super low latency internet connection! DSL is not a good option.
 
[This](https://blog.slock.it/how-to-not-run-an-ethereum-archive-node-a-journey-d038b4da398b) article describes quite well 
the current pain of running a
full node. As a result, the Ethereum 
network currently has less and less nodes that are running as full nodes,
which is a major security concern. Whilst there are attempts by the
Ethereum developer community to address these problems, there
clearly remains a lot to be done in order to keep the chain running
under the exploding load of cryptographic cats.

The picture that emerges more and more is that there's possibly a [scalability trilemma](https://medium.com/@aakash_13214/the-scalability-trilemma-in-blockchain-75fb57f646df), that one can attain at most two out of following three properties:
 - decentralization
 - security
 - scalability

# My recommendation: cryptozombies

A much more effective use of your time than CryptoKitties is to visit [cryptozombies.io](https://cryptozombies.io). 

This is a parody of cryptokitties, yes, but it's way more than that. Instead of congesting the Ethereum blockchain
it's actually a programming course that can teach you how to code smart contracts. 
It's one of the most entertaining and well-developed
resources on learning Solidity that I am aware of.

So feel free to dive in, write your own zombies and have fun!

&lt;br&gt;

.footnote[*Time permitting, we'll develop some smart contract code later on in our lab sessions.]
