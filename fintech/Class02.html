##Our goal today]
.right-column[Since we're interested in technologies that can have
disruptive effect on banking, we'll spend today's class learning about
various facets of financial intermediation. 


Most of external funds of non-financial firms come from financial 
intermediaries, not from markets. That is at first glance surprising:
what's the economic function of the intermediary? 

I'll put on my economist hat today to give you the details. 

We'll learn about the consequences of asymmetric information, and why
intermediaries are able to overcome barriers to trade in this setting.

We'll also learn why intermediaries are potentially fragile.

#Adverse selection

---
#Introduction 

__Asymmetric information__ is one of the most important
concepts in financial economics:

-   it arises whenever in a transaction one side has more (relevant)
    information than the other side

-   it comes in two “flavors”:

     * __Adverse selection:__ *before* agreeing on some transaction, 
        one of the two parties
        has some relevant information that is not known to the other
        party

     * __Moral hazard:__ *after* agreeing on some transaction, one party can take an
        action to its own benefit that is not observed by the other
        party

---

#Adverse selection

-   Imagine there is a transaction to be made: a health insurance is
    about to win a client; a lender is about to make a loan; somebody is
    about to buy a used car.

-   In each of these examples, there is one side that is better informed
    than the other:

    -   the health insurance may not know how bad a risk the customer is
        (whilst the customer knows)

    -   the lender may not know how reliable the borrower really is
        (whilst the borrower knows)

    -   the buyer of the car may not know whether it has hidden defects
        (whilst the seller knows)

-   In such situations, markets don’t function very well:

---
#The curse of adverse selection

In our examples,

  -   the insurance will ask for a relatively high premium (because
      the most risky patients will be most keen on getting insurance)

  -   the lender may ask for a relatively high interest rate

  -   the buyer of the car may only be willing to buy at a steep
      discount in price (reflecting the *average* quality of cars on
      the market)

But then the best types,

   -   the healthiest clients seeking insurance,

   -   the safest borrowers asking for a loan,

   -   the sellers of excellent used cars

may withdraw from the market because they can no longer attain
reasonable conditions for the transaction.

---
#Overcoming adverse selection 

 We call this *adverse selection* (because good types may withdraw
    whereas poor types are more likely to stay in the market). It makes
    it very hard or impossible to trade an asset on which one side 
    has more information than another `\(\Rightarrow\)` _illiquidity_.

__Countermeasures:__ What can be done against adverse
selection?

Answer: _Reduce / eliminate information asymmetries!_

-   government regulation to increase information

-   private collection of information

    -   example: health examination before taking insurance

    -   but in the context of securities purchases, there can be
        free-rider problems:
        if you generate private information and act based on it, others
        may observe your actions, imitate them and free-ride
        
    -   in the context of securities, one can solve the free-rider
        problem if, after acquiring information, the security is
        purchased exclusively by an informed intermediary: bank lending!

#Banks as informed lenders

---
# Informed lending

There is broad consensus in the banking literature that one key activity
of banks is __information acquisition__:
 * They acquire information ex-ante 
(before the loan is approved) to know more about their borrowers and mitigate adverse selection. 
 * They keep collecting further information
ex-post (after the loan has been made) to ensure that the money is
not used for improper purposes (we call this _monitoring_).
For example, most banks that lend to construction firms have their
own construction engineers that regularly visit the construction site
and evaluate progress before the next tranche of the loan is paid out.



---
# Relationship banking
If banks keep acquiring information over the entire course of a 
credit agreement, they end up being better informed about the
borrower than anyone else when the loan has been repaid: banks
learn by lending. 

It is therefore quite natural that many banks, especially small ones
with dense branch networks, invest in building long-lasting relationships with their borrowers. 

For borrowers, this is double edged sword:
better informed relationship lenders offer more reliable 
access to credit, but can also afford charging higher interest
because they enjoy an information monopoly over their long-term
borrower.*

.footnote[*The idea of hold-up in a borrowing relationship
was first presented by [Sharpe, 1990](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1990.tb02427.x).]






---
# Relationship banking: geographic proximity
Most relationship lenders are in close geographic proximity to their 
borrowers and have a dense branch network.

For example, [Degryse and Ongena](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00729.x) (2005)
find in a study of Belgian banks that banks are geographically close to customers: The median borrower is located around 4 minutes and 20 seconds from the lender at a travel speed of 20 mph, i.e. 2.25 km distance.
  
There's plenty of evidence that the quality of a bank's information
    for the purposes of lending deteriorates substatially with increasing 
    distance to its borrowers, see e.g.
    [Granja, Leuz and Rajan](https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3271079) (2018).
    
In other words, credit-relevant information 
is to a substantial share of _local_ nature.

# Informed lending in a digital world

These days, Facebook, Google and other techs know much more about us than all banks combined. Banks' information advantage has eroded. This creates
new opportunities for entry. 

Moreover, we all leave digital data traces every single day.

FinTech lenders have been using people's [digital footprint](http://money.cnn.com/2013/08/26/technology/social/facebook-credit-score/) in facebook and other social media for quite some time
to evaluate the creditworthiness of applicants who have no
official credit score.

Are such data any good? It seems so:

[Berg, Burg, Gombovi and Puri](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24551.pdf) (2018) have shown in a dataset of 250,000 registrations at a German
e-commerce website that the digital traces that we are leaving 
while shopping online are more precise predictors of our creditworthiness
than the credit scores of credit bureaus.

We will talk much more about alternative creditworthiness testing in the second half of the course.

#Liquidity transformation

---
#Illiquid bank assets

In acquiring information, banks reduce the
information gap between lenders and borrowers. This has
another side effect: the better the bank knows its borrowers,
the greater becomes the bank's information advantage over
anyone else in the economy as far as its loans are concerned.

This is no problem if the bank never has to sell any loans.
But it also means that the loans will be very illiquid and hard to sell because 
the bank's information advantage creates asymmetric information
problems between the bank and the prospective buyers of the loans.

As many loans have long maturities whilst most bank deposits
can be withdrawn anytime, this is a potential problem.

We'll demonstrate the consequences of this __liquidity transformation__
in the [Diamond-Dybvig (1983)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1837095.pdf) model.

# Diamond-Dybvig (1983)
### An illiquid asset

Let's model an illiquid asset in a stylized way:

* There are three periods `\(t=0, 1, 2\)`. 

* The illiquid "long" asset matures in period `\(t=2\)`. 

* Every unit of the long asset gives `\(t=2\)` a payoff of `\(R&gt;1\)`. 
  If liquidated early in `\(t=1\)`, however, it can only be sold at a
  value `\(l &lt; 1\)`. 

### Consumers

There is a continuum of identical consumers. Each has an endowment of 1 at `\(t=0\)`, and can consume at either `\(t=1\)` or `\(t=2\)`. At the beginning of the game in `\(t=0\)`, consumers don't know (yet) when they will want to consume.

---

### Liquidity preferences

At `\(t=0\)`, consumers are not certain as to when they want to consume. They will learn about this only in `\(t=1\)`. There is a probability `\(\pi_1\)` that they need to consume early in `\(t=1\)`. We will call those early consumers the _impatient_ consumer types. With probability `\(\pi_2=1-\pi_1\)` they are _patient_ and consume late in `\(t=2\)`. Assuming a concave utility function `\(u(\cdot)\)` with `\(u^\prime &gt; 0, u^{\prime\prime} &lt; 0\)`, their utility from consuming
`\(c_1\)` in period 1 and `\(c_2\)` in period 2 is therefore given by

$$
u(c_1, c_2)  = \left\lbrace \begin{array}{ll}
      u(c_1) &amp; \text{w. prob.}\pi_1 \newline
      u(c_2) &amp; \text{w. prob.}\pi_2
  \end{array}
  \right.
$$
This model assumption captures what one can observe as a pervasive
pattern in financial markets: 
investors
are hesitant to purchase illiquid financial assets because they don't
know when they will need the money due to an unforeseen
liquidity shock.

---
## Solving the model
### Benchmark 1: Autarky. 

If consumers are unable to trade with anyone, what would their allocation 
be? How much welfare would they enjoy?

If they invest in `\(t=0\)` an amount of `\(I\)` in the long asset and `\(1-I\)` 
in the short asset, then:

 * If they end up being impatient, they get to consume `\(c_1=lI+(1-I)\)` by liquidating the long asset early in `\(t=1\)` plus consuming all short asset payoffs.
 * If consumers end up being patient, they obtain `\(c_2 = RI + (1-I)\)` in 
 period `\(t=2\)`.

How much can they consume if they choose `\(I\)` optimally? Without solving
this question, we can see that because of `\(l&lt;1\)`, any choice of `\(I\)` 
implies that `\(c_1 \leq 1\)` and `\(c_2 \leq R\)`, with __one of these 
two inequalities holding strictly.__ It is not possible to
attain a consumption of `\(c_1=1, c_2=R\)` in autarky.
---
### Allowing for trade
If we allow consumers to trade between each other, we can improve
upon autarky. This would work by allowing impatient consumers to
sell in `\(t=1\)` a bond to patient consumers: instead of liquidating
the long asset at a loss, they would keep holding it, sell a bond
in `\(t=1\)` to patient consumers that offers one unit of consumption
in `\(t=2\)` for price `\(p\)` in `\(t=1\)`, use the proceeds from selling the
bond to consume early, and repay the bond with the payoff of the 
long asset in `\(t=2\)`. 

Patient consumers would use all their short asset holdings to
purchase `\((1-I)/p\)` bonds in `\(t=1\)` from impatient consumers.

$$
c_1 = pRI + (1-I)
$$
$$
c_2 = RI + \frac{1-I}{p}
$$
As you can see, the two equations imply that `\(c_1 = p c_2\)`.

Note that the utility of agents increases in `\(I\)` if `\(pR &gt; 1\)`, and decreases in `\(I\)` if `\(pR &lt; 1\)`. This means that the only price at which an
interior optimum `\(I\in(0,1)\)` can exist must satisfy `\(pR=1\)`, hence `\(p=1/R\)`.
---
###Allowing for trade (cont.)

What are the allocations that are attained? Plug `\(p=1/R\)`, and for any `\(I\)`
we get `\(c_1 = 1\)`, and `\(c_2 = R\)`
which is strictly better than autarky.

###Benchmark 2: Can one do even better?
Let's ask a benevolent social planner to allocate 
resources at will as to maximize expected utility of all agents in
the economy. It will surely be optimal to pay for all `\(t=1\)` 
consumption with the short asset, and for `\(t=2\)` consumption with
the long asset. The optimization problem becomes

`$$\max_{c_1, c_2, I} \pi_1 u(c_1) + \pi_2 u(c_2)$$`
subject to
`$$\pi_1 c_1 = 1-I \text{, and}\\
\pi_2 c_2 = RI$$`

---
Substituting the constraints into the objective function, we have
$$
U(I) = \pi_1 u\left(\frac{1-I}{\pi_1}\right) + \pi_2 u\left(\frac{RI}{\pi_2}\right)
$$
which we can maximize by differentiating with respect to `\(I\)`. 
This yields the first-order condition

$$
-u^\prime(c_1^\ast) - Ru^\prime(c_2^\ast) =  0
$$

Our solution with trade, `\(c_1 = 1, c_2=R\)` will satisfy this condition
at best by coincidence: __The market solution is not efficient here.__

In particular, if `\(u^\prime(1) &gt; Ru^\prime(R)\)`, there is more
marginal benefit to first period consumption than what the (incomplete)
market solution attains: `\(c_1^\ast &gt; 1\)`.

### Banks

A financial intermediary could receive deposits of `\(1\)` at `\(t=0\)` and
promise withdrawal of `\((c_1^\ast, c_2^\ast)\)` in `\(t=1\)` and `\(t=2\)`, 
respectively. By law of large numbers, the aggregate impatient  and patient consumers withdrawals are deterministic, and by choosing 
`\(I\)` accordingly, the planner's optimum can be reproduced including
`\(c_1^\ast&gt;1\)` which benefits impatient consumers.

---
### Liquidity intermediation and financial panics

What banks essentially are in the Diamond-Dybvig model
is __liquidity intermediaries__: they hold illiquid assets, yet they
allow withdrawal of liquid deposits at any point in time, 
providing liquidity insurance for depositors.

This is a great benefit. We think it's one of the core functions of banks.

But the same liquidity transformation is also the root of inherent
__instability__: the bank can only meet the withdrawals of the impatient depositors from short asset liquidations.

Imagine that some patient depositors come to believe
that other patient depositors are withdrawing `\(c_1 &gt; 1\)` in `\(t=1\)`.
Then they must conclude that the bank must liquidate the long asset
at a loss to meet those withdrawals, and not enough is left to pay 
them `\(c_2^\ast\)`; if they believe that enough other patient depositors are
withdrawing early to make their payoff fall below `\(c_1^\ast\)`, they 
will want to withdraw immediately. 

The result is a __bank run__: both patient and impatient depositors 
attempt to withdraw at `\(t=1\)`. Beliefs about others withdrawing early 
suffice to sustain a financial panic.

---
#Deposit insurance and moral hazard

This key insight of Diamond and Dybvig (which was refined later by
[Goldstein and Pauzner, 2005](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00762.x)) is that liquidity transformation makes banking inherently 
unstable and runs can occur because of depositors' beliefs about
other depositors' actions.

The problem of depositor runs is not limited to traditional financial
intermediaries. Every liquidity transformation opens up the
potential for runs. 

One way of resolving depositor runs is government-provided
_deposit insurance_: if an
insurance guarantees that all depositors will always receive their
promised payment, patient consumers will no longer run.
This can create stability, but it's a double-edged sword:
deposit insurance also induces banks to take 
greater risks into their books because deposits rates will
becomes less sensitive to the actual risk that the bank is exposed to.
After all, due to insurance, depositors are always paid!

For this reason, depository institutions are subject
to heavy oversight by regulators to discourage such 
_risk shifting_.
