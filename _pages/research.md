## Working papers

__[Bank competition, information choice and inefficient lending booms](https://silviopetriconi.github.io/files/petriconi2016.pdf)__ 
:  If loan offers of informed banks are observed by uninformed competitors, 
   it becomes optimal for banks to lend excessively and screen too little in good times. Via this externality, bank competition drives inefficient credit cycles.


__[The redistributive effects of bank capital regulation](https://silviopetriconi.github.io/redist.pdf)__ 
_(with E. Carletti & R. Marquez)_
:  In a general equilibrium model of bank capital, we show that
   depositors are likely to bear most of the cost of stricter regulatory
   capital standards, whereas shareholders may benefit from regulation.
