## Working papers

__[Bank competition, information choice and inefficient lending booms](https://silviopetriconi.github.io/files/petriconi_lending_boom.pdf)__ 
:  If loan offers of informed banks can be observed by uninformed competitors, 
   banks will lend excessively and screen too little. More bank competition exacerbates the problem and yields inefficient boom-bust cycles in credit.


__[The redistributive effects of bank capital regulation](https://silviopetriconi.github.io/files/CMP_redistributive_regulation.pdf)__ 
_(with E. Carletti & R. Marquez)_
:  In a general equilibrium model of bank capital, we show that
   depositors are likely to bear most of the cost of stricter regulatory
   capital standards, whereas shareholders may benefit from regulation.


__[Geeks Bearing Gifts: Competition and Information Sharing in Knowledge-Based Service Industry](https://silviopetriconi.github.io/files/knowledgesharing.pdf)__ _(with Doh-Shin Jeon)_
:  In a service economy where domain-specific knowledge and service value 
are co-created by service providers and customers, hold-up concerns 
prevent customers from supplying efficient levels of collaboration effort.
We show that the commitment to share customer-specific gains in knowledge 
with competitors, for example via the release of commercial software under 
open source licensing, can be an optimal strategy under competition.
