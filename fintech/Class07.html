#Database vs. Blockchain

---
# Private blockchains

With blockchain technology maturing, many firms have started wondering
whether to adopt Blockchain for real-time documentation of inter- and intra-firm processes.

For many of those processes, blockchain's immutability and 
shared writability is
much more important, payment functionality is irrelevant, 
and the parties that should have write access to the chain (typically,
business partners) are
known upfront. 

This has led to the emergence of __private blockchains__, i.e. blockchains
that are using a permissioned access system and are only shared between
a closed number of business partners, each of which can identify by
some cryptographic authentication.

In a private blockchain with identity management,
consensus can be attained e.g. by voting. No
proof of work is needed to prevent Sybil attacks.

#Private blockchains: some economic reasons
Economists have long been emphasizing
the impact of the __costly state verification problem__ 
on the contractual relations between firms ([Townsend, 1979](https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0531(79%2990031-0)): it can be very
costly to verify the actually realized 
state of nature which limits state-contingent
contracting. An unforgeable record of actions and state history 
can help reduce the costly state verification problem and 
increase efficiency.

Of course, another economic friction that can be alleviated by private
blockchains is __moral hazard__, i.e. the existence of
asymmetric information about hidden actions of a 
contract partner; essentially, blockchain can serve as a monitoring
device to generate information about such actions.

An excellent reference for anyone who wants to think about the 
impact of blockchain on corporate governance is the 2017 paper by
David Yermack, you can find it [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/rof/rfw074).

# Do you even need a Blockchain?

Like with any new technology, blockchain is
 * poorly understood by managers,
 * fueling unrealistically high expectations on some ends, whilst
 * having greatly underestimated potential along other dimensions.
 
Some people who didn't even understand blockchain bought a private
blockchain solution for their business for lots of money
just to discover that a distributed database would have served
their purpose much better. 

We're now going to read and discuss [this](https://medium.com/block-chain/why-blockchain-must-die-in-2016-e992774c03b4) article by Bart Suichies
which has been actually quite influential for
practitioners nowadays in how they think about reasons for (and against!) blockchain
adoption.

We also look at [this](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/375.pdf) research paper on the same topic.

#Blockchain totally does(n't) make sense

Sometimes you can literally see from looking at a document that
some boss has asked top $ consultants to write up "something" about
the blockchain future. The report always comes on glossy paper and may
not be as informative as it should.

For example, IATA (the association of airline industry)
has published
[this](https://www.iata.org/publications/Documents/blockchain-in-aviation-white-paper.pdf) study about the use of Blockchain in aviation. It is in my view representative of many other
documents that I've seen about commercial blockchain applications (and many business debates about blockchain). 
Without wanting to offend the authors, I'd 
claim that the study isn't really very deep and is missing important points.
Let's dig deeper, let's now have a critical discussion whether
blockchain is really a good approach for the kind of problems that are mentioned here, such as
 * frequent flyer programs
 * passenger identity/preference management
 * certification of crew
 * certification of airframe airworthiness

# Blockchain and DRM

Digital rights management  (DRM) is often used for ebooks, music, games etc.

The idea basically is that in order to use the digital good, its "owner"
must prove that the good is genuine by connecting to a central database
in which the ownership is recorded. 

The problem is that sellers of digital goods have been unable to commit
to keep the database running forever (at cost). Even Microsoft recently
[shut down its ebook DRM server](https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-ebook-apocalypse-drm/), 
essentially expropriating their ebook buyers.

The ex-ante anticipation of the lack of ability to commit to 
operate costly DRM infrastructure makes buyers hesitant to buy DRM 
protected digital goods in first place.

[This](https://medium.com/smartz-blog/can-blockchain-and-smart-contracts-protect-copyright-267e105a9ee) article argues that blockchain has a good
chance of becoming the cornerstone of solutions that 
effectively address the copyright licensing problem. I strongly agree. It also fits with the setting that led to
the initial invention of 
Blockchain by [Haber and Stornetta (1991)](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00196791).

# Blockchain and B2B sales

One area of application of blockchain which I personally believe to
be very promising in the future is business to business transactions.

Relative to retail sales, B2B sales are greatly complicated by
 * the lack of instant price quotes because suppliers use first degree 
   price discrimination, charging one customer a multiple of what
   they charge another for the same good or service
 * the importance of due diligence (limiting the risks from the counterparty)
 * the absence of buyer protection regulations that protect final
   good consumers (e.g. reversal of burden of proof for warranty claims)
 * customization of purchase contract conditions
 * frequent involvement of several jurisdictions and international law
 
All of this is a costly burden for firms, but they can't delegate it 
to intermediaries. Why? Because intermediaries' access to firm core
data would give it dangerous power over the firm. 

Blockchain, when combined with privacy technologies like zero knowledge proofs
(more later), can offer a way to facilitate B2B trade without creating
an omnipotent intermediary. We will now discuss how.

#Hyperledger

# Blockchain technology for everyone

How do IBM and all the others go about implementing blockchain solutions 
for their customers?

They could write a blockchain from scratch. Better business model:
develop a good 
blockchain solution once, publish it as open source, 
let others find more bugs, and deploy the
open source solution everywhere, charging for expertise and certification
rather than software itself!

In this way, [several](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects) commercially developed __permissioned blockchain implementations__
have found their home in the [Hyperledger umbrella project](https://www.hyperledger.org), which itself lives under the
roof of the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org)*. Some important blockchain implementations in the Hyperledger project are:
  * Hyperledger Fabric
  * Hyperledger Sawtooth
  * Hyperledger Iroha
  * Hyperledger Besu 


.footnote[*The Linux foundation is the same non-profit 
entity that also supports development activities around the Linux kernel.]

# Hyperledger Fabric

With the variety of available solutions it's not always easy to
have a clear overview of what's best for which purpose. If you're 
new to hyperledger, [this](https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Hyperledger-Overview_May-2018.pdf) slide set will give you the first orientation,
but there's quite some learning involved before you can deploy 
one of the ledgers.

The most popular permissioned distributed ledger so far remains __Hyperledger Fabric__. IBM is using Fabric in most of its consulting
projects (like the Walmart food certification that we saw earlier).
Unlike Ethereum, smart contract logic ("chaincode") runs not in a
distributed VM, but in isolated Docker containers; supported 
chaincode languages are node.js, Java or Golang. Chaincode is 
installed and maintained by ledger sysadmins.

I'll discuss now on the whiteboard the functioning of a basic Hyperledger Fabric 
system. If you're not attending class, you can get up to date by skimming over [this](https://medium.com/swlh/hyperledger-chapter-1-foundation-7ad5bd94d452) ten-piece series of articles, focusing only on the points
how Fabric works, and skipping the actual setup instructions*. 

.footnote[*unless you
want to set up your own Hyperledger Fabric system, which would of 
course be great. But be aware that Docker and VirtualBox don't
coexist peacefully on the same computer, which is why I'm refraining
from bringing Hyperledger Fabric live in the lab.]

# Banks as issuers of private money

]


.pull-right[In the U.S. [Free Banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_banking) era,
private banks regularly issued notes as claims against 
bank deposits. These bank notes played a currency-like role, but
in sharp contrast to currency they were privately issued money.


Usually a note would circulate at a discount that was greater at
larger geographical distance to the bank where it could be redeemed.

]

In hindsight it is not very surprising that a large U.S. bank with long-standing tradition became the first bank to issue in 2019
claims on its deposits in the form of a blockchain-operated
digital currency!

# JPM Coin

Technologically, JPM Coin runs on a private blockchain called
[__Quorum__](https://www.goquorum.com) which is basically a fork of Ethereum that includes important modifications:
 * private, __permissioned__ distributed ledger, controlled by the bank itself
 * support for __private transactions__ that are not visible to anyone
   except the parties involved in the transaction. Crucial e.g. for
   financial market trading applications where you can get fried if
   others know or infer the market position that you've been taking.
 * __backed 1:1__ by the bank's fiat reserves
 
In early 2019, JPM Coin was rolled out for use by other banks and firms.
So far, it 
is not (yet) open for use by the general public:

&gt;_"JPM Coin is currently designed for business-to-business money movement flows, and because we are still in a testing phase, we don’t have plans to make this available to individuals at this stage. That said, the cost-savings and efficiency benefits would extend to the end customers of our institutional clients."_
 
Personally, I believe that JPM will have less difficulty than [Ripple](https://www.ripple.com) to
convince business to join. They have decades of history and reputation.

# Understanding Libra's technological base
For Bitcoin and Ethereum, the White Paper was a good starting place to go to
learn what's going on. Not so with Libra. Their [White Paper](https://libra.org/en-US/white-paper/)
leaves more things more vague than we would like at our stage of understanding, but it's simply meant not to scare
blockchain newcomers.

A more useful paper is the technical paper of Libra which can be found 
[here](https://developers.libra.org/docs/assets/papers/the-libra-blockchain.pdf).

We'll go over some of its main insights. If you're not attending class, please
read the paper carefully.

#Central Bank Digital Currency


---
# The worries

A currency like Libra bring central banks into a difficult situation:
 * it's a currency that might soon become more attractive than
   many of the smaller world currencies.
 * yet it's issued by a private entity with no cental bank having any
   control
 * widespread adoption of Libra will lead to large accumulation
   of safe assets in hands of its operators, scarcity of safe
   assets outside. 
 * it may interfere with transmission of monetary 
   policy, central banks may lose control of 
   stabilizing national currency value.
   
Why not issue a central bank backed digital currency? As [this](
https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d174.pdf) report of the BIS points
out, there are major concerns as well, including that
 * programmable currency could greatly increase risks to financial
 stability: bank depositors could quickly flee to ultimate currency, greatly __exacerbating bank run risk!__ 
 * international competition of digital
 national currencies

Events will force central banks to move soon. In August 2019, [news breaks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-10/why-china-s-rushing-to-mint-its-own-digital-currency-quicktake) that China will soon issue digital Yuan, putting its currency on a path to take a leading position in the digital world of tomorrow...

Sometimes, new technologies bring old ideas back to new relevance and glory.

The issuance of private currency by players like JPM or Facebook makes
one wonder what a world in which several flavors of private currency, with
different properties, coexist. 

The Nobel price winning economist [Friedrich von Hayek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek) had been
wondering nearly half a century ago what a world with several competing
private currencies might look like. The outcome of his thinking
is a small but very insightful little book entitled "Denationalization of Money: The Argument Refined" that you can download
freely [here](https://mises.org/library/denationalisation-money-argument-refined). Highly recommended!
